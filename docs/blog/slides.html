<p>I wrote my slides for a conference presentation recently using Typst
and <a href="https://github.com/andreasKroepelin/polylux">polylux</a>,
and I really enjoyed it.</p>
<p>I love plain text and despise PowerPoint because of the lack of
styles. Which means that each style must be edited individually. Yes I
know you can edit the master slide, but I find that annoying.</p>
<p>Typst is so much easier than LaTeX/Beamer as itâ€™s so much faster and
nicer to work with.</p>
<p>Anyway, Typst looks really promising and handles unicode well.</p>
