<h1>Small tools – the Swiss army knife of translation tools</h1>
</header>
<article>
<p>Somewhere along the line I learned to write code - starting with
Excel, Visual basic, C#, and then Python. Now I can fiddle in Javascript
when necessary and with lots of looking things up.</p>
<p>Python and Javascript are so useful for translation because they
provide simple ways to create small tools to interact with data. Nodejs
and Python make writing command line tools simple and easy.</p>
<p>Data… There’s lots of data on the Bible. Some of it easy to access,
some of it not. Thankfully James Tauber’s <a
href="https://github.com/jtauber/vocabulary-tools">vocabulary-tools</a>
contains a packages <code>gnt_data</code> that makes is easy to interact
with the Greek New Testament.</p>
<p>Using that package, I clobbed together a script to find verses
containing lemmas and then print them in a simple string format where
each book is separated by <code>;</code> and references within a book
are separated by <code>,</code> which gives something like
<code>MRK 1:1,2:1;JHN 14:1;ACT 1:1,2:2,5:4"</code>.</p>
<p>I can then pipe this into a variety of other small tools. I have a
bash script that takes this input and uses <a
href="https://wiki.crosswire.org/Frontends:Diatheke">diatheke</a> to
display each of these references in the translation of my choice,
current Lexham English Bible, found in freely available <a
href="https://www.crosswire.org/sword/modules/index.jsp">Sword
modules</a>.</p>
<p>I have a nodejs script that can parse USFM files using <a
href="https://github.com/Bridgeconn/usfm-grammar">usfm-grammar</a> and
display a list of references.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-small-tools-matter">Why do small tools matter?</h2>
<p><strong>They can do things more quickly or easily than Bible study
websites and software.</strong> Looking up a list of verses usually
requires looking at them one at a time. This is slow and tedious.</p>
<p><strong>In some cases to do things that the software can’t
do.</strong> I love Logos Bible Software, but to my knowledge it can’t
read USFM files.</p>
<p><strong>These small tools are also composable.</strong> Once script
finds a list of where lemmas occur. One script displays a list of verses
in Sword modules (diatheke) and one displays them in USFM files.</p>
<p><strong>They are easily modified and extended.</strong> If I wanted
my bash script to use diatheke to display multiple translations or to
also display the Greek NT text, it would be as simple as copying bash
script, copying the line that calls diatheke and changing what package
diatheke displays.</p>
<p><strong>They are sharable.</strong> With blogs and sites like GitHub,
it’s easy to share scripts so they can be useful to others.</p>
<p>Learning to write scripts is a learning curve, but it’s not
impossible and is certainly easier than many of things we have to learn
related to the Bible (Greek or Hebrew for example). Should you do so?
Maybe? Maybe not?</p>
