title: Writing notes in Paratext

I'm working multiple teams at the moment and when I come back to review answers from a team, I pretty much have to reread or skim most of the initial note that I wrote to remember why I wrote and then check their response. 
This means that shorter, simpler notes that are well structured and easy to get this gist of are more helpful. I suggest that using tags for parts of the notes could be helpful. Something like the following could be a useful template. 

```
Category: Accuracy|Clarity|Naturalness|Acceptability
Text: 
Summary/Issue: 
Details: 
Suggestion:
```
`Category` would identify the translation problem type. `Text` would be the text the note discusses or a shortened version thereof. `Summary` would be a statement of the issue as briefly as possible and the `Details` would basically be the rest of the note including reasons, quotations, etc. Finally `Suggestion` would be the recommended change (if any). 

Some notes may need each of these and others may not. The whole point is to make it as quick as possible to remember what at note is about when reading it. Incidentally, it will make it easier for the translation team as well. 

I think this is the primary value using a template or CONNOT style. Speed.
