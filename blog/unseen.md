title: Unseen Realm
---

Recently I've been revisiting Unseen Realm my Michael S. Heiser in a big way. Actually, I've been reading a number of his books: Demons (done) and also Reversing Hermon (in progress). 

One of the biggest takeaways has been how much of what the NT authors are doing I've missed over the years, especially as it relates to how Jesus refers to Himself. "Son of God" and "Son of Man" have so much more meaning than I thought and perhaps mean slightly different things that I thought.

Another shift is realizing in a new way how different the worldview of the biblical authors is from mine. I know this, but seeing it again and feeling it more is helpful. 

These books are also a call to read the text closely and to question whether my current framework is based on the text, ancient context, or the traditional readings I've grown up with. The later are so powerful and so hard to read around (see past??).
