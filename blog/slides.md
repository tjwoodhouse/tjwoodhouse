title: Writing my first presentation in Typst.
---

I wrote my slides for a conference presentation recently using Typst and [polylux](https://github.com/andreasKroepelin/polylux), and I really enjoyed it. 

I love plain text and despise PowerPoint because of the lack of styles. Which means that each style must be edited individually. Yes I know you can edit the master slide, but I find that annoying.

Typst is so much easier than LaTeX/Beamer as it's so much faster and nicer to work with.

Anyway, Typst looks really promising and handles unicode well.
