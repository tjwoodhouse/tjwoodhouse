In the last few days I ran across [The Cult of Done Manifesto](https://thomasdeneuville.com/cult-of-done-manifesto/) by Kio Stark and [Bre Pettis](https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13). It's in various places on the internet and it's basically a call for creatives to create, finish, and move on to the next things with out worrying about having it perfect. 

I suppose it also applies to programmers and other jobs where there may be a temptation to tinker with something until it's perfect before shipping it and seeing what people think. 

In the world of translation, I think this has some applications, but perhaps not as many as it may in other places. 

If a team tries to make their draft perfect before testing it in the community, this is a problem. Testing reveals blind spots and problems the team was unaware of. So getting the translation to the feedback stage quickly is good. But, and here's a big but, there's no point in pushing it to that state until the team is reasonably sure that it's accurate and reasonably accurate. 

Point 2 of the manifesto says "Accept that everything is a draft." This is valuable because translations are never really done. Languages keep evolving, and each round of feedback, each new book translated, means that the team's understanding is evolving and thus edits and revisions may need to happen. Thankfully we live in a digital age where things can be updated easily and released incrementally (assuming the readers have access to phones and computers to read Scripture on). 

A lot of the other points may not apply at all. Like point 7 "Once you're done you can throw it away" or point 3 "There is no editing state". Translation is mostly editing and returning to things and making them better. 

Points 8, 9, 10, and 13 can apply as perfection simply isn't possible without lots of feedback so we need to get things off the translation desk and into people's hands to get feedback. Finishing verses, chapters, and books does become a flywheel because as teams decide how to render phrases and key terms they can render them more quickly the next time they are encountered so "Done is the engine of more" (point 13) in this case. 

Anyway, this Manifest is worth pondering.
